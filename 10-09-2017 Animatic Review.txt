Scene 03 - Adjust timing to give more of a gap between older and younger boy. Keys are good, needs more timing work to extend; Needs time to have some "closure" to the climbing action before the cut.

Scene 05 - Bear shadow across the foreground

Scene 06 - Definitely need monkeys/birds now

Scene 08 - Add more acting to the bear; Boys are good timing-wise;

Scene 22 - drag out the tension, teeth and drool; use Ben's crazy tongue(?)

Ending approved. Younger boy leaves and Older boy ponders
